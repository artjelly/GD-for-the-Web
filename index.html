	<p>Big Country are a Scottish rock band formed in Dunfermline, Fife, in 1981. The height of the band's popularity was in the 1980s, although it retained a cult following for many years after. The band's music was most recognisable for the sounds it infused with Scottish folk and martial music <strong>styles</strong>, as well as for playing and engineering their guitar driven sound to evoke the inspirational spirit of bagpipes, fiddles and other traditional folk instruments.</p>
